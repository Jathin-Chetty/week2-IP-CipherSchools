                    A paragraph is a series of related sentences developing
                    a central idea, called the topic. Try to think about 
                    paragraphs in terms of thematic unity: a paragraph is 
                    a sentence or a group of sentences that supports one 
                    central, unified idea. Paragraphs add one idea at a 
                    time to your broader argument.
